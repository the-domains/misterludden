## Presidents of the United Space: Phase 1
![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/812c2d9d-c5a0-4279-b350-186ee309db15.png)

_Presidents of the United Space_ is an ongoing sci-fi comic project featuring past presidents fighting for a future utopia. I'm working on it with my wife Ginger through our comic/art studio_Chris & Gin._

The current lineup of presidents includes George Washingtron (a robot George Washington), Ted-E Roosevelt (bear/human hybrid), Thomas Jefferson (an now immortal man), and a time-travelling Abe Lincoln.

The first phase of the project was two mini-comics published in 2015\. Each book contained two short stories featuring a different president and addressing a different virtue (wisdom, community, etc.). You can [download both for 99 cents][0] or [order paper copies][1].

In 2016 we plan to launch a graphic novel length POTUS tale.
